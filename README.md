this is a collection of many janked scripts for me to learn how to build, tons of random stuff from progamming books, online tutorials, videos, the majority of the scripts is generated by chatgbt as i tinker and learn along. expect alot of unfinished junk unless noted

- conway of life

so far i have 2 scripts, one is cml text based from a book the other is a gui run by pygame, only the pygame version works.

controls:

1. click on any spot to turn into a cell white/ or back to black
2. press space to run the program
3. press "r" to reset the program
